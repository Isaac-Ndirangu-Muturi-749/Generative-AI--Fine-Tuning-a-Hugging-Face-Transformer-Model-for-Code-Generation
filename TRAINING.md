## Data Preparation

Before training the model, you need to prepare your dataset, and ensure it's formatted properly for code generation. The evol-codealpaca-v1 dataset is commonly used for this purpose.

## Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune the model, follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
2. Customize the tokenizer and model for code generation.
3. Define the training arguments for your task, including batch size, learning rate, and other hyperparameters.
4. Create a data collator for your specific use case, such as DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM.
5. Set up Progressive Embedding Fine-Tuning (PEFT) configuration and quantization settings.
6. Create a Trainer for training the model.
7. Train the model using the defined dataset and Trainer.

Make sure to save the trained model after training.

## Training Arguments

- `output_dir`: The directory to store training checkpoints and logs.
- `overwrite_output_dir`: Whether to overwrite the output directory if it already exists.
- `per_device_train_batch_size`: Batch size for each training device.
- `logging_steps`: The frequency of logging during training.
- `save_steps`: Save checkpoints every N steps.
- `num_train_epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `optim`: The optimizer type (e.g., paged_adamw_32bit).
- `warmup_ratio`: The proportion of steps dedicated to warm-up.
- `lr_scheduler_type`: Learning rate scheduler type.
- `fp16`: Use mixed-precision training (float16).
- `max_grad_norm`: Maximum gradient norm to prevent exploding gradients.

## Monitoring Training

To monitor the training process, you can use WandB (Weights and Biases) or other monitoring tools. WandB allows you to visualize training metrics, log hyperparameters, and store experiment details.

## Storing and Sharing the Model

After training, save the model using the `model.save_pretrained()` method. The saved model can be stored in the "outputs" directory and shared as needed. You can also use the Hugging Face Model Hub to host and share your model with the community.
